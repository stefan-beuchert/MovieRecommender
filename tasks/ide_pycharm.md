# My IDE

I used the PyCharm IDE for my project.

My first choice for an IDE would have been Visual Studio Code. But after I had decided to implement my project in Python, I chose PyCharm. This was not because of any specific feature, but just the fact that I had heard of PyCharm in the past and wanted to test it out.


Some features that made my life easier while implementing this project are:
* Code completion
* Easy refactoring
* The overall simple UI with the possibility to open multiple tabs and highlight files, that are tracked by git
* The terminal, which I used a lot


Sadly I realized only after implementing most of the core features, that I could have used the Professional edition for free, because I am a student. This would have me allowed to use .http / .rest files, which can send http-request directly from the IDE. I had to use Postman for this. Also I could have used an integrated support for IPython Notebook, which would have made it possible to run and edit .ipynb files inside of the IDE.

Now I know better for the next time :)

My favorite shortcuts are:
* 'ctrl' + '/' (on the numpad), for commenting out a block of code, or reversing this process
* hitting 'shift' twice, for quickly going in search mode
* 'ctrl' + 'alt' + 'l', for reformating the current file, without going through the suggestion menu
