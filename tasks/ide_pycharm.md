# My IDE

I used the PyCharm IDE for my project.

My first choice for an IDE would have been Visual Studio Code. 
But after I had decided to implement my project in Python, I choose PyCharm. 
This was not beacause of any specific feature, but just the fact that 
I had heard of PyCharm in the past and wanted to test it out.

Some features that made my life easyer while implementing this project are:
* Code completion
* Easy refactoring
* The over all simple UI with the possibility to open multiple tabs and highlight files, that are tracked by git
* The terminal, which I used a lot

Sadly I realized only after implementing most of the core features, 
that I could have used the Professional edition for free, because I am a student.
This would have me allowed to use .http / .rest files, which can send http-request direcly from the IDE.
I had to use Postman for this.
Also I could have used an integrated support for IPython Notebook, which would have made it possible to run and edit
.ipynb files inside of the IDE.

Now I know better for the next time :)

My favorite shortcuts are:
* 'ctrl' + '/' (on the numpad), for commenting out a block of code, or reversing this process
* hitting 'shift' twice, for quickly going in search mode
* 'ctrl' + 'alt' + 'l', for reformating the current file, without going throug the suggestion menu
